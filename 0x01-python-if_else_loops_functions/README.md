## Introduction

Python is a versatile programming language that offers various control structures to make decisions, perform repetitive tasks, and define reusable blocks of code. This project focuses on the following core topics:

    - If-else statements: Learn how to write conditional statements to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions.
    - Loops: Explore different types of loops such as for and while to iterate over sequences or perform actions repeatedly.
    - Functions: Understand the concept of functions, their benefits, and how to define and call functions in Python.

Each topic is explained in a simple and concise manner, providing code examples and explanations to facilitate understanding.
Getting Started

Topics Covered

The project covers the following topics:

    If-else statements:
        Syntax and basic usage
        Comparison operators
        Nested if-else statements
        Multiple conditions using logical operators

    Loops:
        for loop: iterating over sequences, lists, and dictionaries
        while loop: executing code until a certain condition is met
        Loop control statements: break and continue

    Functions:
        Defining and calling functions
        Function parameters and return values
        Scope of variables within functions
        Recursive functions

Examples

The examples directory contains various code examples that demonstrate the usage of if-else statements, loops, and functions. Each example is accompanied by detailed comments to explain the code's functionality and expected output.
Exercises
